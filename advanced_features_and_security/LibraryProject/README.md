# **Managing Permissions and Groups in Django**

## **Overview**

In this documentation, I’ll walk you through how I implemented role-based access control (RBAC) in my Django application using Django's built-in `Group` and `Permission` models. The main goal was to create user roles—`Admins`, `Editors`, and `Viewers`—each with specific permissions related to managing books and libraries in the application. I'll highlight the crucial steps, particularly focusing on the `groupaction.py` script and the necessary modifications to the `models.py` file.

## **1. Defining Custom Permissions in `models.py`**

### **Step 1: Add Custom Permissions**

First, I defined custom permissions in the `Book` and `Library` models to control actions such as viewing, creating, editing, or deleting records. This is done by adding the `Meta` class inside each model.

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey('Author', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ('can_view_book', 'Can view book'),
            ('can_create_book', 'Can create book'),
            ('can_edit_book', 'Can edit book'),
            ('can_delete_book', 'Can delete book'),
        ]

class Library(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ('can_view_library', 'Can view library'),
            ('can_create_library', 'Can create library'),
            ('can_edit_library', 'Can edit library'),
            ('can_delete_library', 'Can delete library'),
        ]
```

### **Explanation**

- **Custom Permissions**: These permissions are added to the `Meta` class of each model. For instance, the `Book` model includes permissions for viewing, creating, editing, and deleting book records. Similarly, the `Library` model has its set of permissions.

## **2. Managing Permissions and Groups with `groupaction.py`**

The `groupaction.py` script is the heart of the RBAC setup. It defines the groups and assigns the appropriate permissions to each group.

### **Highlighted Script: `groupaction.py`**

```python
# Import necessary modules for managing groups and permissions
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission
from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
from bookshelf.models import Book, CustomUser, Library

# Step 1: Define the groups and their associated permissions
groups_permissions = {
    'Admins': ['can_view_book', 'can_create_book', 'can_edit_book', 'can_delete_book',
               'can_view_library', 'can_create_library', 'can_edit_library', 'can_delete_library'],
    'Editors': ['can_view_book', 'can_create_book', 'can_edit_book', 
                'can_view_library', 'can_create_library', 'can_edit_library'],
    'Viewers': ['can_view_book', 'can_view_library']
}

# Step 2: Create groups and assign permissions to them
for group_name, permissions in groups_permissions.items():
    group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name=group_name)
    
    for perm in permissions:
        model_name = perm.split('_')[2]  # Extract model name
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get(model=model_name)
        permission = Permission.objects.get(codename=perm, content_type=content_type)
        group.permissions.add(permission)

    if created:
        print(f'Created group: {group_name}')
    else:
        print(f'Group already exists: {group_name}')

    for perm in permissions:
        print(f' - Added permission: {perm} to group {group_name}')

print('Group and permission setup complete.')
```

### **Explanation**

- **Groups**: The script defines three groups—`Admins`, `Editors`, and `Viewers`. Each group is associated with specific permissions.
- **Permission Assignment**: Permissions are assigned to groups using a loop that extracts the model name from the permission codename and retrieves the relevant `ContentType` and `Permission` objects.

## **3. Testing Permissions in Django Shell**

After setting up the groups and permissions, I used the Django shell to create users and assign them to the appropriate groups. Here’s a brief overview:

```python
>>> from bookshelf.models import CustomUser
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import Group

# Create test users
>>> CustomUser.objects.create_user(email='user1@example.com', password='password123', username='user1')
>>> CustomUser.objects.create_user(email='user2@example.com', password='password123', username='user2')
>>> CustomUser.objects.create_user(email='user3@example.com', password='password123', username='user3')

# Fetch users and assign them to groups
>>> user1 = CustomUser.objects.get(email='user1@example.com')
>>> user2 = CustomUser.objects.get(email='user2@example.com')
>>> user3 = CustomUser.objects.get(email='user3@example.com')

# Add 'user1' to the 'Editors' group
>>> editors_group = Group.objects.get(name='Editors')
>>> editors_group.user_set.add(user1)

# Add 'user2' to the 'Viewers' group
>>> viewers_group = Group.objects.get(name='Viewers')
>>> viewers_group.user_set.add(user2)

# Add 'user3' to the 'Admins' group
>>> admins_group = Group.objects.get(name='Admins')
>>> admins_group.user_set.add(user3)

# Verify permissions
>>> print(f"Editors group permissions: {[perm.codename for perm in editors_group.permissions.all()]}")
>>> print(f"Viewers group permissions: {[perm.codename for perm in viewers_group.permissions.all()]}")
>>> print(f"Admins group permissions: {[perm.codename for perm in admins_group.permissions.all()]}")
```

## **4. Enforcing Permissions in Views**

I enforced these permissions in my views by using the `@permission_required` decorator.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required, login_required
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect, get_object_or_404

@login_required
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_view_book', raise_exception=True)
def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'book_list.html', {'books': books})

@login_required
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_create_book', raise_exception=True)
def add_book(request):
    # Book creation logic here
    pass

@login_required
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_edit_book', raise_exception=True)
def edit_book(request, book_id):
    # Book editing logic here
    pass

@login_required
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_delete_book', raise_exception=True)
def delete_book(request, book_id):
    # Book deletion logic here
    pass
```

## **5. Setting Up URLs**

The corresponding URLs were defined in 'urls.py' to map these views:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('books/', views.book_list, name='book_list'),
    path('books/add/', views.add_book, name='add_book'),
]
```

## **6. Testing the Setup**

To ensure that everything was working correctly, I performed a series of tests:

1. **Run the `groupaction.py` script**:
   - This script sets up the groups and assigns the permissions. Running it ensures that the correct permissions are assigned to each group.

2. **Register and Login Users**:
   - I created test users and assigned them to different groups (`Admins`, `Editors`, `Viewers`) using the Django Admin panel.

3. **Check Access Control**:
   - I logged in as different users and verified their access to various views (`book_list`, `add_book`, `edit_book`, `delete_book`).

4. **View in Browser**:
   - I checked the HTML pages to ensure that the correct buttons/links appeared based on the user’s permissions.


## **7. Conclusion**

By implementing RBAC in my Django application, I was able to control access to different parts of the application based on user roles. The `groupaction.py` script plays a crucial role in managing these permissions, while the custom permissions defined in `models.py` ensure that access is tightly controlled. Testing these permissions in the Django shell confirmed that the setup works as intended, ensuring a secure and functional application.
