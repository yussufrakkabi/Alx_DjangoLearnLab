# Django Blog Application

## Overview

Welcome to the Django Blog Application! This project is a fully functional blogging platform where users can register, create, edit, and delete blog posts, comment on posts, tag them, and search for posts by keyword or tag. Built with Django, this application emphasizes usability, content organization, and search functionality.

This README file will guide you through the core features of the blog application, its setup, and usage.

## Core Features

The Django Blog Application implements the following key features:

1. **User Registration & Profile Management**: 
   - Users can register, log in, update profiles, and manage their personal information.

2. **Post Management**:
   - Authenticated users can create, edit, update, and delete blog posts.
   - Posts are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first).

3. **Comment Functionality**:
   - Users can comment on blog posts and manage their own comments (edit/delete).

4. **Tagging System**:
   - Posts can be tagged with multiple tags.
   - A tag cloud feature helps categorize and organize posts.

5. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search for posts by keywords (title, content, or tags).

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12.x
- MySQL Database
- Pip (Python package manager)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Alx_DjangoLearnLab
cd Alx_DjangoLearnLab/django_blog
```

### 3. Set Up the Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install django mysqlclient python-dotenv black django-taggit
```

### 5. Configure the Database

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your database credentials and other environment variables. Here is an example `.env` file:

```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

# MySQL Configuration
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

Ensure that MySQL is properly installed and running on your system. You may need to create a database manually.

### 6. Run Migrations

After setting up the `.env` file and configuring the database, apply migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin and manage your application, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the admin account.

### 8. Run the Development Server

Once everything is set up, you can start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application.
